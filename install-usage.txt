Usage:

-o:   Makes a bacup of '~/.config/dwm' if exists and copies my 
      config to that route.
 
-r:   Only makes a cp -r src/* '~/.config/dwm/'. This command does not
      make any backup. Maybe is not recommended.

-i:   Checks if '~/.config/dwm' exists. Only copies my config to that
       path if the mentioned path dont exist. If everything is fine, 
       compiles and installs dwm.
      
-h:   Shows this message.
